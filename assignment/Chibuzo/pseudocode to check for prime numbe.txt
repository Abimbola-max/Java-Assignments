pseudocode to check for prime numbers
prime numbers are numbers that has 2 divisors
the divisors are it factors, which is 1 and itself 
1. declare and initialize "number" of type int
2. declare and initialize primeCounter to be 1
3. using for loop to divide the number, counter starts from 2
4. ends when it gets to the number
5. check if the number is a prime number by dividing "number" by counter 
6. If the remainder is 0, add 1 to primeCounter
7. if primeCounter is zero, it means no counter has been able to divide it without remainder 
8.  return true
9. If the primeCounter is more than 0, this means the number is odd  
10. the function will return false
11. display result
